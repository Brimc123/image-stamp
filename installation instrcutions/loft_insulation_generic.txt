LOFT INSULATION - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
PAS 2035 COMPLIANT INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. PRE-INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

1.1 HEALTH & SAFETY
• Wear appropriate PPE: dust mask (FFP3 rated), safety goggles, gloves, and protective clothing
• Ensure adequate ventilation in the loft space
• Use appropriate lighting equipment
• Ensure safe access via suitable ladder or loft ladder
• Lay boarding across joists for safe working platform
• Never stand between joists - always work from boards
• Be aware of low headroom and protruding nails

1.2 SITE ASSESSMENT
• Confirm loft space is accessible and has minimum 400mm headroom
• Check for adequate ventilation (eaves ventilation, ridge vents)
• Inspect roof condition - check for leaks, damaged tiles, or structural issues
• Identify and mark location of electrical cables, water pipes, and services
• Check existing insulation type and depth
• Identify any recessed light fittings requiring protection
• Locate water tanks and ensure adequate insulation around (but not underneath) them
• Check for evidence of condensation, damp, or pest infestation

1.3 PREPARATION WORKS
• Clear loft space of stored items where insulation will be installed
• Ensure all electrical work is completed to Part P standards before installation
• Install loft caps over any recessed downlighters to prevent overheating
• Ensure adequate ventilation maintained at eaves (minimum 25mm air gap)
• Seal any gaps in the ceiling below to prevent air leakage
• Install warning notice near loft hatch: "CAUTION - INSULATION INSTALLED TO 270-300MM DEPTH - DO NOT COMPRESS"

2. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

2.1 MATERIAL HANDLING
• Store insulation in dry conditions prior to installation
• Allow insulation materials to reach ambient temperature before use
• Handle rolls carefully to avoid damage and compression
• Check product meets required thermal performance (minimum 0.16 W/m²K)

2.2 INSTALLATION METHOD - COLD LOFT (BETWEEN JOISTS)
• Start installation from eaves working towards centre of loft
• Lay first layer of insulation between joists, ensuring it reaches the eaves but does not block ventilation
• Butt joints tightly together with no gaps
• Cut insulation to fit neatly around pipes, cables, and services (do not compress)
• Ensure insulation is pushed right to the eaves but maintains 25mm ventilation gap
• For top-up insulation, lay second layer perpendicular to joists to minimize cold bridging
• Target depth: 270mm minimum (typically 100mm between joists + 170mm over joists)
• Do not insulate underneath cold water tanks (keep warmth rising from rooms below)
• Insulate all pipes and water tanks to prevent freezing

2.3 INSULATION AROUND SERVICES
• Electrical cables: Lay cables on TOP of insulation or clip to joists above insulation level
• Do NOT bury cables in insulation as this can cause overheating
• Water pipes: Ensure pipes are insulated separately with pipe insulation
• Ensure pipes are positioned above insulation where possible to benefit from warmth below
• Recessed lights: Install appropriate fire-rated covers (loft caps) before insulating
• Maintain minimum 100mm clearance around flues and chimneys
• Ensure insulation does not block any ventilation pathways

2.4 LOFT HATCHES
• Insulate loft hatch to same standard as main loft area
• Fit draught excluder around hatch opening
• Install hatch insulation using rigid insulation board or insulated hatch kit
• Ensure hatch can still open and close properly after insulation fitted

2.5 EAVES VENTILATION
• CRITICAL: Maintain continuous ventilation at eaves
• Install eaves ventilation trays if not already present
• Ensure minimum 25mm air gap between insulation and roof deck at eaves
• Check ventilation is not blocked by insulation

3. QUALITY CHECKS

3.1 INSTALLATION VERIFICATION
• Confirm insulation depth meets specification (270mm minimum)
• Check for gaps between insulation sections
• Verify eaves ventilation is maintained and not blocked
• Confirm all services are properly protected
• Check loft hatch is insulated and draught-sealed
• Verify warning notices are installed
• Ensure no insulation is compressed or damaged

3.2 FINAL INSPECTION
• Photograph installed insulation showing depth and coverage
• Record insulation type, thickness, and thermal performance
• Document any areas not insulated (e.g., access routes, around chimneys)
• Provide homeowner with installation certificate and product warranties

4. CUSTOMER HANDOVER

4.1 INFORMATION TO PROVIDE
• Explain importance of not compressing insulation
• Advise on safe loft access and storage considerations
• Provide warning about increased trip hazard due to insulation depth
• Explain importance of maintaining ventilation
• Provide product warranties and guarantees
• Issue insurance-backed guarantee certificate

4.2 MAINTENANCE ADVICE
• Inspect annually for settlement, damage, or pest infestation
• Check loft ventilation remains clear
• Monitor for any signs of condensation or damp
• Do not store heavy items on insulation as this will compress and reduce performance
• Consider installing loft boarding if storage required

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5. COMPLIANCE & STANDARDS

This installation procedure complies with:
• PAS 2035:2023 - Retrofitting dwellings for improved energy efficiency
• Building Regulations Part L1B - Conservation of fuel and power in existing dwellings
• BS 5250:2021 - Management of moisture in buildings
• TrustMark Standards

Thermal Performance Target: U-value of 0.16 W/m²K or better

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

6. IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES

• DO NOT insulate under water tanks - keep ceiling warm beneath tanks
• DO NOT bury electrical cables in insulation
• DO NOT block ventilation at eaves or ridge
• DO NOT install insulation around or too close to flues/chimneys (maintain 100mm gap)
• DO NOT walk between joists without boarding
• ALWAYS maintain electrical safety - cables must not overheat
• ALWAYS maintain fire safety - minimum clearances around heat sources
