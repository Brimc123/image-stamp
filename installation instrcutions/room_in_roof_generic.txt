• Install vapour control layer (VCL) on warm side of insulation
• Overlap joints by minimum 150mm
• Tape all joints with appropriate VCL tape
• Seal around all penetrations (cables, pipes)
• Ensure continuity with VCL in adjacent areas
• Take VCL behind any internal partition walls
• Seal edges to roof structure

4.4 VERTICAL WALL SECTIONS (KNEE WALLS)
• Insulate vertical stud walls to same standard as sloping ceiling
• Install insulation between studs
• Add second layer if required to achieve U-value
• Maintain continuity with sloping roof insulation (no cold bridges)
• Install VCL on warm side
• Ensure no gaps at junctions

4.5 FLAT CEILING SECTIONS (IF APPLICABLE)
• Install insulation between and below ceiling joists
• Ensure continuity with sloping ceiling insulation
• Maintain ventilation in loft space above (if cold roof)
• Do not block ventilation pathways

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5. SERVICES INSTALLATION

• Route electrical cables on warm side of insulation where possible
• Do NOT bury cables in insulation (overheating risk)
• Clip cables to ceiling boards or run in trunking
• Install appropriate fire-rated downlight covers for recessed lights
• Maintain minimum clearances from heat sources
