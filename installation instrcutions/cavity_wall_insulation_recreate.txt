PAS 2035 COMPLIANT INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. PRE-INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

1.1 COMPETENCY & CERTIFICATION
• Installer must hold appropriate certification (CIGA, BBA, BSI approved)

• Understanding of Building Regulations and PAS 2030/2035
• Familiar with moisture management and damp prevention
• Knowledge of different insulation materials and their applications
• Understanding of wall tie condition assessment

1.2 SITE SURVEY & ASSESSMENT (CRITICAL)
**Cavity wall insulation is NOT suitable for all properties**

Conduct thorough survey to assess suitability:

**Wall Construction Check:**
• Confirm cavity wall construction (not solid wall)
• Measure cavity width (minimum 50mm required, ideally 75mm+)
• Check wall ties present and in good condition
• Identify wall construction materials (brick, block, stone)
• Assess external wall condition and exposure rating

**Exposure Assessment:**
• Property location and exposure to wind-driven rain
• Sheltered (suitable for CWI)
• Moderate (may be suitable - assessment required)
• Severe/Very Severe (NOT suitable for CWI - high risk)
• Use BRE exposure maps or local knowledge

**Cavity Inspection:**
• Use borescope inspection to check cavity condition:
  - Cavity clear of debris and mortar droppings
  - Wall ties visible and in good condition
  - No significant bridging or blockages
  - Cavity dry with no signs of moisture penetration
• Inspect at multiple locations (minimum 4 inspection holes)

**Damp Assessment:**
• Check for existing damp issues:
  - Rising damp
  - Penetrating damp
  - Condensation
• Use moisture meter on internal wall surfaces
• Look for staining, mould, or previous damp damage
• **DO NOT INSTALL if damp issues present - resolve first**

**Wall Condition:**
• Check external render/pointing condition
• Identify any cracks or defects
• Check DPC (damp proof course) present and intact
• Verify no bridging of DPC with soil, paths, or debris
• Check airbricks/vents not blocked

1.3 SUITABILITY EXCLUSIONS
Do NOT install cavity wall insulation if:
• Cavity width less than 50mm
• Property in severe/very severe exposure zone
• Existing damp problems present
• Wall ties corroded or missing
• Cavity significantly obstructed
• External walls in poor condition (cracked render, failed pointing)
• Property has history of penetrating damp
• Below ground cavities present without tanking

4. INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

4.1 HOLE DRILLING PATTERN
• Standard pattern: 1m horizontal spacing, 1m vertical spacing (staggered)
• Drill from outside wall face
• Typical hole diameter: 22mm or 25mm (depending on material and equipment)
• Drill at mortar joints where possible (not through bricks)
• Avoid drilling near windows, doors, and openings
• Start from top of wall working downward
• Drill full depth of external wall leaf (typically 100-110mm)

**Drilling Locations:**
• First row: 150-200mm below eaves/top of wall
• Middle rows: 1m spacing vertically
• Bottom row: 150-200mm above ground/DPC level
• Columns: 1m spacing horizontally, staggered between rows

4.2 CAVITY INSPECTION DURING DRILLING
• Inspect cavity through drill holes using borescope
• Verify cavity clear and suitable for insulation
• Check wall tie condition
• Confirm no unexpected obstructions
• Measure actual cavity width
• Stop installation if unsuitable conditions discovered

4.3 INSULATION INSTALLATION

**General Procedure:**
• Start installation from bottom of wall working upward
• Insert injection nozzle into drill hole
• Fill cavity with insulation material
• Work systematically across wall
• Monitor filling process to ensure complete coverage
• Watch for material appearing at adjacent holes (indicates blockage)

**Mineral Wool Installation:**
• Blow mineral wool fibers into cavity under pressure
• Control flow rate to achieve correct density
• Typical density: 25-30 kg/m³ for 50mm cavity, 30-35 kg/m³ for wider cavities
• Fill each hole section until material rebounds
• Move nozzle to next hole when section filled
• Ensure consistent packing throughout cavity

**Polystyrene Bead Installation:**
• Mix beads with adhesive as per manufacturer's instructions
• Inject bead/adhesive mix into cavity
• Ensure adequate coverage and bonding
• Monitor setting time
• Adhesive must coat beads adequately for water resistance

**Polyurethane Foam Installation:**
• Inject foam in controlled manner
• Allow for expansion of foam
• Do not overfill (excessive pressure can damage walls)
• Monitor curing process
• Ensure even distribution throughout cavity

4.4 QUALITY CONTROL DURING INSTALLATION
• Monitor insulation density/coverage continuously
• Check pressure gauges on equipment
• Listen/feel for material flow
• Watch for material escaping from vents or openings
• Verify material consumption matches expected volume
• Adjust technique if coverage issues identified
• Use thermal imaging if available to verify coverage

4.5 SPECIAL DETAILS

**Around Openings:**
• Take extra care around windows and doors
• Drill additional holes if required for complete coverage
• Ensure insulation does not block weep vents
• Maintain clearance from window/door frames

**At Floor Levels:**
• Ensure insulation fills full height of cavity at each floor
• Check for obstructions at floor joist positions
• May require additional holes at floor levels

**At Services:**
• Identify all service penetrations before drilling
• Avoid drilling near gas, electric, or water services
• Maintain clearance from flues and vents
• Do not block airbricks or ventilation
