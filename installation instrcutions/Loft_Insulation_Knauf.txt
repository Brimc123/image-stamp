LOFT INSULATION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (Knauf Earthwool)

1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE
This document outlines the procedure for installing loft insulation using Knauf Earthwool Loft Roll, in compliance with PAS 2030:2023 and PAS 2035:2023. The objective is to improve thermal performance of the loft while maintaining adequate ventilation and preventing condensation.

2. PRE-INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
- Conduct a risk assessment in accordance with PAS 2030 Annex B.
- Verify that the loft space is free of damp, leaks, and pests.
- Check existing insulation depth and identify any electrical cables or downlight fittings.
- Ensure eaves ventilation is unobstructed and insulation will not block air paths.

3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
- Knauf Earthwool Loft Roll (various thicknesses as per design specification)
- Protective PPE: gloves, mask, overalls, goggles
- Loft board walkway (for access)
- Measuring tape, knife, and insulation supports

4. INSTALLATION PROCESS
- Lay insulation between joists, ensuring full coverage without compression.
- For top-up insulation, cross-lay perpendicular to joists to achieve target depth (typically 270–300 mm total).
- Maintain 25 mm ventilation gap at eaves.
- Keep clear of cold water tanks and electrical fixtures.
- Install insulation supports around services as necessary.

5. QUALITY CHECKS AND TESTING
- Confirm even insulation depth across entire loft.
- Check no insulation obstructs ventilation pathways.
- Verify access hatch is insulated and draught-sealed.
- Photograph completed work for PAS 2030 compliance record.

6. HANDOVER AND DOCUMENTATION
- Record insulation thickness and product used.
- Provide homeowner guidance on avoiding loft compression and maintaining ventilation.
- Store documentation in Retrofit Design package as evidence of PAS 2030:2023 compliance.
