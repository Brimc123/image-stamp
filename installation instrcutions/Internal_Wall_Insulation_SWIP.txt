INTERNAL WALL INSULATION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (SWIP System)

1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE
This document describes installation of SWIP internal wall insulation systems in accordance with PAS 2030:2023 and PAS 2035:2023, improving thermal efficiency while controlling condensation risk.

2. PRE-INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
- Conduct pre-works survey to assess substrate suitability, moisture, and ventilation.
- Verify condensation risk assessment (BS 5250) and interstitial condensation modelling.
- Ensure electrical and plumbing services are identified and isolated where needed.

3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
- SWIP IWI board system with vapour control layer (VCL) and fixings
- Mechanical fixings, joint tape, sealant, and ancillary beads
- PPE: mask, gloves, eye protection

4. INSTALLATION PROCESS
- Prepare substrate (clean, dry, sound, and level).
- Fix insulation boards tightly together, staggering joints.
- Seal all perimeters and service penetrations with airtight sealant.
- Fit mechanical fixings as per design specification.
- Apply VCL and ensure continuity at junctions.
- Finish with plasterboard skim or dry lining finish as per design.

5. QUALITY CHECKS AND TESTING
- Inspect joint alignment and VCL continuity.
- Conduct visual inspection for gaps, voids, or thermal bridges.
- Record photographic evidence for each elevation.

6. HANDOVER AND DOCUMENTATION
- Record product batch, thickness, and fixing method.
- Provide homeowner guidance on maintenance and wall fixings.
- Include record within Retrofit Design package under PAS 2030:2023.
