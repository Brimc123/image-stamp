• Installer must be competent in internal wall insulation systems
• Understanding of moisture management and condensation risks
• Familiar with ventilation requirements and Building Regulations
• Competent in dry-lining installation techniques
• Knowledge of damp remediation and treatment

1.2 SITE SURVEY & ASSESSMENT (CRITICAL)
• Conduct thorough damp survey - IWI can only be installed on dry walls
• Check for rising damp, penetrating damp, or condensation issues
• Identify and resolve any damp issues BEFORE installation
• Assess wall construction and condition
• Measure room dimensions and calculate area to be insulated
• Check existing ventilation provision
• Identify services (electrical, plumbing, gas)
• Assess window and door reveals
• Check floor and ceiling junctions
• Identify any thermal bridges requiring attention
• Measure room dimensions to verify minimum room sizes maintained after insulation

1.3 DAMP ASSESSMENT & TREATMENT
CRITICAL: IWI must NOT be installed on damp walls
• Conduct moisture meter readings on all walls
• Investigate and resolve any damp issues:
  - Rising damp: Install or repair DPC
  - Penetrating damp: Repair external defects
  - Condensation: Improve ventilation
• Allow walls to dry completely before proceeding
• Treat any mould growth with fungicidal wash
• Consider breathable insulation systems for solid walls with minor moisture issues

1.4 VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS
• IWI reduces wall breathability - adequate ventilation is ESSENTIAL
• Existing trickle vents must be retained or upgraded
• Consider additional ventilation (mechanical ventilation with heat recovery)
• Background ventilation required: minimum 8,000mm² per habitable room
• Extract ventilation required in kitchens and bathrooms
• Advise customer on ventilation requirements and behaviour changes

  - Existing wall U-value
• Typical thicknesses: 50mm, 75mm, or 100mm
• Consider tapered boards at window/door reveals

3.2 FIXING METHOD SELECTION
• Mechanical fixing to timber battens (most common)
• Dot and dab adhesive method (suitable for flat, sound walls)

• Select based on wall condition, straightness, and room dimensions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

4. INSULATION BOARD INSTALLATION

4.1 BATTEN INSTALLATION METHOD (RECOMMENDED)
• Fix timber battens vertically to wall at 400mm or 600mm centres
• Use appropriate fixings for wall type (masonry screws, anchors)
• Pack out battens to achieve level plane (use packers)
• Use spirit level to ensure battens are plumb and in same plane
• Install additional noggins around openings and service locations
• Treat timber battens with preservative if required

4.2 INSULATION BOARD FIXING
• Measure and cut insulation boards to size
• Cut neatly using fine-toothed saw or insulation saw
• Fit boards between battens, ensuring tight fit
• Secure boards mechanically or with adhesive as per system requirements

• Place board on wall and press firmly
• Use long level to ensure board is plumb and true
• Adjust position before adhesive sets
• Allow adhesive to cure as per manufacturer's instructions

4.4 WINDOW AND DOOR REVEALS
• Insulate reveals to prevent thermal bridging and condensation
• Use tapered insulation boards or cut boards to create splayed reveals
