3. THERMOSTATIC RADIATOR VALVE (TRV) INSTALLATION

3.1 PRE-INSTALLATION PREPARATION
• Isolate heating system and drain down
• OR isolate individual radiators if possible (easier method)
• Protect floor coverings with dust sheets
• Have bucket/container ready for residual water
• Check radiator valves not seized or corroded
• Identify flow and return connections

3.2 REMOVAL OF EXISTING VALVE (IF APPLICABLE)
• Close radiator isolation valves (both ends)
• Bleed radiator to release pressure
• Place container under valve connection
• Unscrew radiator valve from radiator using adjustable spanner
• Unscrew valve from pipe connection
• Clean pipe threads (remove old PTFE tape and debris)
• Check radiator thread condition (replace radiator tail if damaged)

3.3 TRV INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

**Valve Body Installation:**
• Wrap pipe thread with PTFE tape (clockwise, 3-4 wraps)
• Hand-tighten valve onto radiator tail
• Use adjustable spanner to tighten (do not over-tighten)
• Connect valve to pipe (compression or threaded connection)
• Ensure valve installed in correct flow direction (check arrow on valve body)
• Torque to manufacturer's specification

**Important Notes:**
• TRVs should be installed on FLOW side of radiator (not return)
• Check system design - may require bypass if all radiators have TRVs
• Ensure at least one radiator (typically bathroom) has no TRV or lockshield fully open

**TRV Head Installation:**
• Remove transport cap from valve body
• Position TRV head onto valve body
• Ensure correct alignment (follow manufacturer's instructions)
• Secure head to body:
  - Push-fit models: push firmly until click
  - Screw-fit models: tighten retaining ring
  - Clip-fit models: slide on and secure clip
• For electronic TRVs: insert batteries and follow pairing procedure

3.4 TRV POSITIONING
• Mount TRV horizontally where possible (for accurate temperature sensing)
• Vertical mounting acceptable if necessary (follow manufacturer's guidance)
• Ensure TRV head is not obstructed by:
  - Curtains
  - Furniture
  - Radiator shelves
• Keep clear airflow around TRV sensor

3.5 SYSTEM REFILLING
• Close all TRVs to setting 3 (mid-position)
• Refill heating system slowly
• Vent all radiators starting from lowest point
• Continue filling until correct system pressure (typically 1.0-1.5 bar)
• Check all TRV connections for leaks
• Tighten if required (do not over-tighten)

3.6 TRV COMMISSIONING
• Power up heating system
• Set all TRVs to maximum (5 or *) initially
• Run system until all radiators hot
• Balance radiators:
  - Adjust lockshield valves to achieve equal temperatures
  - Typical temperature drop across radiator: 10-12°C
• Set TRVs to desired settings:
  - Setting 1: ~10°C (frost protection)
  - Setting 2: ~15°C (low background heat)
  - Setting 3: ~20°C (comfortable living)
  - Setting 4: ~23°C (warm)
  - Setting 5: ~28°C (maximum/valve fully open)
• Test TRV operation:
  - Turn to maximum - valve should open
  - Turn to minimum - valve should close
  - Feel valve body warming when open

**Electronic/Smart TRVs:**
• Install batteries
• Pair with gateway/hub (if wireless system)
• Configure via app:
  - Set room names
  - Create heating schedules
  - Set target temperatures
• Test wireless communication
• Verify app control functions correctly

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

4. SYSTEM INTEGRATION

4.1 CONTROL HIERARCHY

**Issue:** Heating won't turn off
**Solution:** Check thermostat temperature setting, verify valve not stuck, check for short circuit

**Issue:** Poor wireless signal
**Solution:** Relocate receiver, check for interference sources, consider signal booster

10.2 TRV ISSUES
**Issue:** TRV not closing (radiator always hot)
**Solution:** Check valve not stuck open, ensure pin moves freely, replace valve head

**Issue:** TRV not opening (radiator cold)
**Solution:** Check valve not stuck closed, verify pin depresses, check setting correct

**Issue:** Leaking TRV
**Solution:** Tighten connection gently, check olive seated correctly, replace valve if damaged
