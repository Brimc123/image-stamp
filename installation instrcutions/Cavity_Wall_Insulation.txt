CAVITY WALL INSULATION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (Generic)

1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE
This instruction covers installation of blown cavity wall insulation to improve thermal performance while maintaining compliance with PAS 2030:2023 and PAS 2035:2023.

2. PRE-INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
- Verify property suitability with pre-installation survey (wall tie condition, damp risk, exposure zone).
- Ensure cavity width and wall condition meet system requirements.
- Check that vents and airbricks will remain unobstructed.
- Confirm DPC level and assess for cavity obstructions.

3. MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT
- Approved blown insulation material (e.g., mineral fibre, EPS bead, or PU foam – as per certification)
- Drilling equipment and injection nozzles
- PPE and RPE suitable for dust and noise control

4. INSTALLATION PROCESS
- Drill holes per manufacturer’s pattern (typically 22–26 mm).
- Inject insulation under pressure ensuring full fill of cavity.
- Plug and make good drilled holes to match existing finish.
- Maintain ventilation openings and damp-proof integrity.

5. QUALITY CHECKS AND TESTING
- Check drill pattern uniformity and cavity fill via borescope.
- Ensure no material escapes through vents or openings.
- Conduct post-installation inspection per PAS 2030 Annex B.

6. HANDOVER AND DOCUMENTATION
- Record system type, installer ID, and completion date.
- Provide homeowner with guarantee and maintenance advice.
- Store photographic evidence within Retrofit Design documentation.
